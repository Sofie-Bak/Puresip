**A group project from school where we had to come up with a product, define our target audience, and design a full landing page for it.**

I created the entire website design in Figma based on the product idea we developed together as a team. Once the layout and visual style were locked in, we collaborated on things like the logo and image assets, but the core design concept was mine from start to finish.

After my teammates and I finished developing our assigned sections, I went in and added animations across the whole page to make the site feel polished and dynamic, and to lift out project above others. I also jumped in throughout the project to help my teammates with development challenges and offer advice when needed.

Honestly… I lowkey became the project manager on this one, and I’m proud of that. I kept the design consistent, the code flowing, and made sure everything aligned with our vision.
